question: Can you give a summary of the paper?
answer: The paper proposes a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted strategy to design HE resistant non-equimolar FeCoNiCrMn HEAs. The approach is to calculate the H solution energies using density functional theory (DFT) at critical sites of the HEA lattice, followed by ML algorithms to correlate the local chemical environment with H solution energies. H diffusion coefficients are subsequently calculated from H diffusion barriers by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Whale optimization algorithms (WOA) then allow us to explore HEA atomic structures with low H diffusion coefficients. Finally, using a polynomial model, we construct a mapping between the H diffusion coefficient and the chemical composition of the HEA. The model suggests that we can regulate the H diffusion coefficient of the HEA by tuning its chemical composition. In particular, HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients typically have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. We then developed linear and polynomial models between the chemical composition and the H diffusion coefficient to guide the design of HEAs with low H diffusion coefficient and high HE resistance.

Data-driven material design is an emerging field of research that searches for the optimal material with great efficiency by avoiding the traditional trial-error material development process [26-29]. Here we propose a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted strategy to design HE resistant non-equimolar FeCoNiCrMn HEAs. Our approach is to calculate the H solution energies using density functional theory (DFT) at critical sites of the HEA lattice, followed by ML algorithms to correlate the local chemical environment with H solution energies. H diffusion coefficients are subsequently calculated from H diffusion barriers by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations [10,30]. Whale optimization algorithms (WOA) [31] then allow us to explore HEA atomic structures with low H diffusion coefficients. Finally, using a polynomial model, we construct a mapping between the H diffusion coefficient and the chemical composition of the HEA. The model suggests that we can regulate the H diffusion coefficient of the HEA by tuning its chemical composition. In particular, HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients are predicted to have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. The quantitative model linking the H diffusion coefficient with the chemical composition of HEA is expected to guide the design of high-performance HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients and strong resistance to HE.
The overall flow-chart for designing FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients is presented in Fig. 3. After obtaining the H solution energy through DFT calculations, we adopt the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor [43-46] to represent the chemical environment of a given H atom embedded in a metal lattice and then explore an ML model to correlate its SOAP descriptor to its solution energy. Using the ML model, H solution energies in new HEA structures that are not in the dataset can be evaluated. The prediction of H solution energies in new HEA structures is important because we need to find the optimal HEA structures from a broad compositional and structural space. The H diffusion coefficient of the new structure can be consequently calculated by kMC simulations. It is WOA that allows us to search the compositional and structural space of HEAs for structures with low diffusion coefficients. These structures generated by WOA serve as input to the ML model mentioned earlier to predict the H solution energy distribution. The H diffusion coefficient is then calculated from the H solution energy distribution. Using the large dataset containing HEA structures and H diffusion coefficients, the relationship between the H diffusion coefficient with the chemical composition of the HEA can then be accurately described by a 2-degree polynomial model. The details of each part in Fig. 3 are elaborated hereafter.

question: What’s the motivation?
answer: The paper is motivated by the fact that certain HEAs, such as the prototype Cantor alloy (FeCoNiCrMn) have been found to be much less susceptible to HE than commercially used Ni-based alloys and stainless steel, even at a higher level of H charging. The multiple principal components in HEAs lead to a vast compositional space for designing alloys with strong HE resistance. However, an effective way for designing HE resistant HEAs still requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HE resistance in HEAs.

High entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted intensive interest due to their unique properties such as good ductility [14], high thermal stability [15,16], corrosion resistance [17,18], and excellent low-temperature mechanical properties [19]. Particularly, certain HEAs, such as the prototype Cantor alloy (FeCoNiCrMn) [20-24], have been found to be much less susceptible to HE than commercially used Ni-based alloys and stainless steel, even at a higher level of H charging. The multiple principal components in HEAs lead to a vast compositional space for designing alloys with strong HE resistance. However, an effective way for designing HE resistant HEAs still requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HE resistance in HEAs. It has been proposed that the highly fluctuated local chemical environment and the distorted lattice of HEAs result in a wide distribution of H diffusion energy barriers. The peaks/valleys in the potential energy landscape create numerous H traps [25] in the HEA lattice. To develop an effective design strategy for HE resistant HEAs, it is necessary to identify how the local chemical environment is correlated with the local H trapping energy and clarify how the chemical composition influences the diffusion coefficient.

With the expanded training set after the iterative process, the ML model can accurately predict the H solution energies in non-equimolar HEAs. We then performed another four WOAs to obtain four optimized HEA structures with the improved ML model. The evolution of the diffusion coefficient during WOA and the chemical compositions of the optimized structures after WOA are shown in Fig. 8a and 8b, respectively. Fig. 8a shows that the H diffusion coefficient can be rapidly reduced, indicating that WOA is efficient in exploring the broad and high-dimensional searching space of the current optimization problem. We can see that owing to the broad composition and structure space of the HEA atomic structure, the WOA exploration arrives at different local optimal points each time, and it is not easy to locate the global minimum. However, all the optimized structures have H diffusion coefficients considerably lower than those of the unoptimized ones. The optimized structures are labeled WOA-1 to WOA-4 and their atomic structures are plotted in Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Materials. The charge density distributions of the four optimized structures are representatively shown in Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Materials. It can be seen that the charge density distribution is highly inhomogeneous, which would result in the highly varied H solution energies, and then the formation of various H traps in the HEA lattices. All of the optimized structures are non-equimolar, and typically have high Co content and low Ni content. This suggests that there might be certain relationships between the chemical composition and the H diffusion coefficient of the structure, which make it possible to achieve a low H diffusion coefficient by tuning the chemical composition.

question: What’s hydrogen embrittlement?
answer: Hydrogen embrittlement is a phenomenon where hydrogen atoms accumulate at defects in metals and cause deterioration in the mechanical properties of metals, especially ductility and durability, inducing the so-called hydrogen embrittlement.
Source:
The H solution energy distributions in pure Ni and HEA structures are plotted in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b, respectively. It is clear that EH-solu in HEAs have wider distributions than that in Ni, and the EH-solu in HEAs are highly inhomogeneous. The H diffusion barriers in certain areas are significantly higher than others, implying the H diffusion pathway may be more rugged and the H atoms are highly dragged in HEAs. These results are consistent with the findings of Ren et al. [42] and Zhou and Curtin [25] that the lattices of HEAs can effectively trap H atoms. However, how the chemical composition of the HEA and the local chemical environment affect the H diffusion behavior, and to what extent the H diffusion coefficient can be reduced by the inhomogeneous distribution of EH-solu in HEA, remain to be resolved.
The demand for hydrogen (H) energy is rapidly growing in the current society [1-3]. However, the wide application of H energy faces great challenges in the storage and transportation of H gas for that the presence of mobile H atoms in metals could render serious deterioration in the mechanical properties of metals, especially ductility and durability, inducing the so-call hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The mobile H atoms are prone to accumulate at crystal defects i.e., grain boundaries [4,5], interfaces [6-8], and micro voids [9,10], inducing decohesion or stress concentration, and consequently crack initiation and propagation. One common strategy to increase the HE resistance of metals is to suppress severe H accumulation at defects by slowing down H diffusion through the dispersion of irreversible traps like precipitates [11] or reversible traps like grain boundaries [12] and dislocation walls [13]. However, to trap enough diffusive H, the defects should have sufficient density and proper dispersion in the matrix. Otherwise, H atoms would accumulate at the defects and cause embrittlement. Therefore, novel effective methodologies for trapping diffusive H are in demand.
High entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted intensive interest due to their unique properties such as good ductility [14], high thermal stability [15,16], corrosion resistance [17,18], and excellent low-temperature mechanical properties [19]. Particularly, certain HEAs, such as the prototype Cantor alloy (FeCoNiCrMn) [20-24], have been found to be much less susceptible to HE than commercially used Ni-based alloys and stainless steel, even at a higher level of H charging. The multiple principal components in HEAs lead to a vast compositional space for designing alloys with strong HE resistance. However, an effective way for designing HE resistant HEAs still requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HE resistance in HEAs. It has been proposed that the highly fluctuated local chemical environment and the distorted lattice of HEAs result in a wide distribution of H diffusion energy barriers. The peaks/valleys in the potential energy landscape create numerous H traps [25] in the HEA lattice. To develop an effective design strategy for HE resistant HEAs, it is necessary to identify how the local chemical environment is correlated with the local H trapping energy and clarify how the chemical composition influences the diffusion coefficient.

In total, we built 35 atomic structures (Table 1) for DFT calculations and calculated the H solution energies at the critical sites in the structures. The corresponding atomic structure files can be found in the Supplementary Data. The number of critical sites in each calculated structure ranges from 392 (in binary alloys) to 880 (in quinary alloys). The complete size of the dataset, which contains the atomic positions of critical sites and their corresponding H solution energies in the 35 structures, is 24,566. The atomic positions of the critical sites and the corresponding H solutions of each atomic structure can also be found in the Supplementary Data. The calculated H solution energy distributions in several representative binary, ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys are shown in Fig. 4. The rest of the H solution energy distributions are shown in Fig. S1-4 in the Supplementary Materials. We see that in certain structures, such as FeMn and FeCoMn, the H solution energy distributions are 'narrower', and the energy distributions at saddle and TI sites overlap less. In structures such as CoCr and FeCoNiCrMn, the H solution energy distributions are 'wider' with partially overlapping distributions at saddle and TI points. In addition, the average solution energies at the critical sites of different structures are quite different. For example, the energies at OI sites of the FeNiCrCo structure are centered around -3.1 eV, whereas the energies at OI sites of the FeCoMn structure are centered around -2.95 eV, indicating that the OIs in FeNiCrCo are deeper H traps than those in FeCoMn. The differences in H solution energy distributions will cause large deviations in the lattice-trapping ability, hence we further investigated the influence of HEA structure and composition on the H diffusion coefficient.

In summary, we have proposed a data-driven and ML-assisted prediction and optimization strategy to assist the design of FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients. The neural network was used to bridge the relationship between the SOAP descriptors and the H solution energies. With the help of kMC, the H diffusion coefficients based on the H solution energies can be accurately evaluated, and the relationship between the atomic structure of HEA to its H diffusion coefficient can be built. From the data collected from the WOA processes, we found that HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients typically have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. We then developed linear and polynomial models between the chemical composition and the H diffusion coefficient to guide the design of HEAs with low H diffusion coefficient and high HE resistance.
We further carried out linear regression with the composition of Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn as features and the logarithmic H diffusion coefficient as the learning target. The dataset was split into the training set and the test set with a split ratio of 4:1. The performance of linear regression is shown in Fig. 10a and b. Linear regression gives an R2 value of 0.75 on the test set, indicating that although the variance is large, there does exist a certain relationship between the H diffusion coefficient and the chemical composition. The large variance may come from the nonlinear dependency of the H diffusion coefficient on the chemical composition. It also indicates that as the H diffusion coefficient decreases, the linear prediction becomes less accurate, as shown by the lower-left region of Fig. 10a and b, suggesting that the lack of model complexity manifests itself when predicting low H diffusion coefficients. The linear model gives an explicit expression of the logarithm of H diffusion coefficient as a function of chemical components, i.e.,(8)log(D)=0.096Fe-0.47Co+3.05Ni-1.01Cr-1.66Mn-15.05where Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn represent the atomic ratio of the elements. Eq. (8) suggests that the increased Co, Cr, and Mn ratio can reduce the H diffusion coefficient whereas an increase of Fe and Ni might result in the opposite effect. Note that the linear model fails to make accurate predictions for structures with H diffusion coefficients lower than 10-16 m2 s-1.

The iteration process in Fig. 7a was performed five times to guarantee the accuracy of the ML model. Fig. 7b shows the evolution of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient during the iteration process. After five iteration loops, the predicted and the DFT calculated H diffusion coefficients reached the convergence criterion. Five optimized structures generated in the iteration process are labeled non-equi-HEA-1 to non-equi-HEA-5. (See Fig. S5 in Supplementary Materials for the atomic structures.) The H diffusion coefficient of the non-equimolar HEAs that were evaluated by kMC using the DFT calculated H solution energies are listed in Table S1 in Supplementary Materials.
Data-driven material design is an emerging field of research that searches for the optimal material with great efficiency by avoiding the traditional trial-error material development process [26-29]. Here we propose a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted strategy to design HE resistant non-equimolar FeCoNiCrMn HEAs. Our approach is to calculate the H solution energies using density functional theory (DFT) at critical sites of the HEA lattice, followed by ML algorithms to correlate the local chemical environment with H solution energies. H diffusion coefficients are subsequently calculated from H diffusion barriers by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations [10,30]. Whale optimization algorithms (WOA) [31] then allow us to explore HEA atomic structures with low H diffusion coefficients. Finally, using a polynomial model, we construct a mapping between the H diffusion coefficient and the chemical composition of the HEA. The model suggests that we can regulate the H diffusion coefficient of the HEA by tuning its chemical composition. In particular, HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients are predicted to have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. The quantitative model linking the H diffusion coefficient with the chemical composition of HEA is expected to guide the design of high-performance HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients and strong resistance to HE.
The kMC simulations are used for calculating H diffusion coefficients. Here we only consider the low H-concentration scenario. One H atom was firstly placed in a randomly selected OI site. Due to the complicated local chemical environment of HEA, each OI has 8 different neighboring TIs, so there are 8 different barriers for hopping from OI to TI. The hopping rate to the ith neighboring TI is calculated by(2)ki=v0exp(-DEikBT)

question: What are the computational methods used in this study?
answer: The computational methods used in this study include linear regression, principal component analysis, ridge regression, random forest, and neural network.

After constructing the SOAP descriptors for the critical sites and calculating the corresponding H solution energies, we built the ML model to correlate the local chemical environment of an H atom at a critical site with its solution energy. As presented in Fig. 6, an ML model as simple as ridge regression with built-in cross-validation [47] (referred to as RidgeCV hereafter) can give satisfactory results. RidgeCV outperformed random forest but was slightly inferior to the neural network. Based on the performance of the three ML models, the neural network was selected as the ML model for further prediction of the H solution energy distribution based on the atomic structure of a given HEA.
To define features for each H atom embedded in the 35 structures, we adopt SOAP descriptors [43] as they accurately describe the local chemical environment surrounding the target H atom within a certain cutoff. There are three important hyperparameters to be optimized when constructing a SOAP descriptor, namely, the radial cutoff (rcut), the maximum number of radial basis functions (nmax), and angular degree of the spherical harmonics (lmax). To evaluate the influence of these hyperparameters on the model accuracy, we use the mean square error (MSE) as a performance measure and use linear regression as the ML model. The whole data set was split into a training set (85%), validation set (5%), and test set (10%). We used the validation set for selecting hyperparameters of the SOAP descriptors, while the test set was used for evaluating the performances of the ML models. The whole data set can be found in Supplementary Data (see the 'x_arr.npy' and 'y_arr.npy' files for the SOAP descriptors and the H solution energies).
The variation of MSE with increasing rcut, nmax and lmax is depicted in Figs. 5a-c, which indicates that for rcut=7, nmax=4 and lmax=4, the MSE is near-optimal for predicting H solution energies in the validation set. The generated SOAP descriptor is a vector with 1500 components. However, many components of the SOAP descriptor are close to zero, contributing little to the learning target. Therefore, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension of the features. As shown in Fig. 5d, MSE reaches a steady-state value provided the feature number is no less than 600. Therefore, we use 600 as the feature number of the original SOAP descriptors for further analysis.

The WOA method, which is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm [31], was applied to explore the HEA structure with low H diffusion coefficients. WOA mimics the hunting strategy of humpback whales, which starts from encircling the prey with multiple whales, followed by the bubble-net attacking phase, and then the prey searching phase. WOA is an efficient algorithm for structural optimization and displays an excellent balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling searching across a broad space for the optimal solution. However, the WOA method needs modification to search the structural and compositional space of the HEA structure. To be consistent with the structures for the DFT calculation of the H solution energies in quinary HEA, we use the 2 x 2 x 5 FCC supercell with a total of 80 atoms as the optimization object. To search the structural and compositional space simultaneously, each atom of the supercell is allowed to choose from the five elements

The WOA optimizations are then performed to explore HEA structures with low H diffusion coefficients. Despite the broad search space of the WOA optimization, the H diffusion coefficient can be effectively reduced by 2 orders of magnitude after merely 300 WOA steps with five whales for hunting, wherein the optimized structures are non-equimolar. Because the local chemical environments and the corresponding H solution energies in the training set are all calculated from either pure-metal structures or equimolar-alloy structures, the ML model displays relatively low accuracy in the prediction of H diffusion coefficients of non-equimolar HEA. To address this issue, we performed additional DFT calculations on the optimized non-equimolar structures to obtain H solution energies at the critical sites, and then iteratively added these DFT calculation results along with their corresponding SOAP descriptors to the training set to enhance the accuracy of the ML model predictions (see Fig. 7a). The iteration stops when the convergence criterion between the predicted and DFT calculated H diffusion coefficients is reached.

Hence, the atomic structure of the HEA supercell has 580 permutations. By using integers ranging from 1 to 5 to represent the element type and an 80-component vector to represent the permutation of the atoms, we can then iteratively optimize the atomic structure of the HEA supercell to gradually lower the H diffusion coefficient using WOA. We use a vector, X, to represent the atomic structures of HEA. X has two key characteristics: all the elements are integers, and the elemental index should be in the range of 1-5. In addition, we expect the optimized structure to contain all the five elements of HEA, so the structures with less than five elements are excluded. During the optimization, the components of X can easily exceed the range of 1-5. The X will be initiated with random integers in the range of 1-5 if any components of X are lower than 1 or higher than 5. We used 5 whales for hunting within one WOA iteration and performed 300 iterations. The python codes for WOA are presented in the Supplementary Materials.

question: What is the definition of the hydrogen solution energy?
answer: The hydrogen solution energy is the energy required to dissolve a hydrogen atom in a metal lattice.
Source:
The H solution energy distributions in pure Ni and HEA structures are plotted in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b, respectively. It is clear that EH-solu in HEAs have wider distributions than that in Ni, and the EH-solu in HEAs are highly inhomogeneous. The H diffusion barriers in certain areas are significantly higher than others, implying the H diffusion pathway may be more rugged and the H atoms are highly dragged in HEAs. These results are consistent with the findings of Ren et al. [42] and Zhou and Curtin [25] that the lattices of HEAs can effectively trap H atoms. However, how the chemical composition of the HEA and the local chemical environment affect the H diffusion behavior, and to what extent the H diffusion coefficient can be reduced by the inhomogeneous distribution of EH-solu in HEA, remain to be resolved.
The demand for hydrogen (H) energy is rapidly growing in the current society [1-3]. However, the wide application of H energy faces great challenges in the storage and transportation of H gas for that the presence of mobile H atoms in metals could render serious deterioration in the mechanical properties of metals, especially ductility and durability, inducing the so-call hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The mobile H atoms are prone to accumulate at crystal defects i.e., grain boundaries [4,5], interfaces [6-8], and micro voids [9,10], inducing decohesion or stress concentration, and consequently crack initiation and propagation. One common strategy to increase the HE resistance of metals is to suppress severe H accumulation at defects by slowing down H diffusion through the dispersion of irreversible traps like precipitates [11] or reversible traps like grain boundaries [12] and dislocation walls [13]. However, to trap enough diffusive H, the defects should have sufficient density and proper dispersion in the matrix. Otherwise, H atoms would accumulate at the defects and cause embrittlement. Therefore, novel effective methodologies for trapping diffusive H are in demand.
The overall flow-chart for designing FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients is presented in Fig. 3. After obtaining the H solution energy through DFT calculations, we adopt the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor [43-46] to represent the chemical environment of a given H atom embedded in a metal lattice and then explore an ML model to correlate its SOAP descriptor to its solution energy. Using the ML model, H solution energies in new HEA structures that are not in the dataset can be evaluated. The prediction of H solution energies in new HEA structures is important because we need to find the optimal HEA structures from a broad compositional and structural space. The H diffusion coefficient of the new structure can be consequently calculated by kMC simulations. It is WOA that allows us to search the compositional and structural space of HEAs for structures with low diffusion coefficients. These structures generated by WOA serve as input to the ML model mentioned earlier to predict the H solution energy distribution. The H diffusion coefficient is then calculated from the H solution energy distribution. Using the large dataset containing HEA structures and H diffusion coefficients, the relationship between the H diffusion coefficient with the chemical composition of the HEA can then be accurately described by a 2-degree polynomial model. The details of each part in Fig. 3 are elaborated hereafter.

question: Describe the detailed DFT settings.
answer: The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [34,35]. Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [36] functional of generalized gradient approximation with projector augmented wave (PAW) [37] was adopted to describe the electronic structures of HEAs. The plane-wave basis kinetic energy cut-off was set to 400 eV. All calculations were carried out with spin-polarization switched on. During the geometrical optimizations, all atoms and the simulation cells were allowed to relax, so that the lattice distortion was taken into consideration when calculating the H solution energies. The total energy was converged to less than 10-6 eV for the electronic structure optimization. The convergence criterion for geometric optimization for calculating H solution energy was set to 0.1 eV, and the criterion for optimizing the atomic structure of the lattice was set to 0.001 eV. The atomic structure of the lattice was relaxed firstly, and then the H atoms were placed at the TIs, and OIs in the lattice.

The attempt frequency v0 used here is 10-14 m2 s-1, which is calibrated to match the H diffusion coefficient in coarse-grained Ni [41]. The python code for the kMC simulation is presented in the Supplementary Materials.
The iteration process in Fig. 7a was performed five times to guarantee the accuracy of the ML model. Fig. 7b shows the evolution of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient during the iteration process. After five iteration loops, the predicted and the DFT calculated H diffusion coefficients reached the convergence criterion. Five optimized structures generated in the iteration process are labeled non-equi-HEA-1 to non-equi-HEA-5. (See Fig. S5 in Supplementary Materials for the atomic structures.)

The iteration stops when the convergence criterion between the predicted and DFT calculated H diffusion coefficients is reached.
With the expanded training set after the iterative process, the ML model can accurately predict the H solution energies in non-equimolar HEAs. We then performed another four WOAs to obtain four optimized HEA structures with the improved ML model. The evolution of the diffusion coefficient during WOA and the chemical compositions of the optimized structures after WOA are shown in Fig. 8a and 8b, respectively. Fig. 8a shows that the H diffusion coefficient can be rapidly reduced, indicating that WOA is efficient in exploring the broad and high-dimensional searching space of the current optimization problem. We can see that owing to the broad composition and structure space of the HEA atomic structure, the WOA exploration arrives at different local optimal points each time, and it is not easy to locate the global minimum. However, all the optimized structures have H diffusion coefficients considerably lower than those of the unoptimized ones. The optimized structures are labeled WOA-1 to WOA-4 and their atomic structures are plotted in Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Materials. The charge density distributions of the four optimized structures are representatively shown in Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Materials. It can be seen that the charge density distribution is highly inhomogeneous, which would result in the highly varied H solution energies, and then the formation of various H traps in the HEA lattices. All of the optimized structures are non-equimolar, and typically have high Co content and low Ni content. This suggests that there might be certain relationships between the chemical composition and the H diffusion coefficient of the structure, which make it possible to achieve a low H diffusion coefficient by tuning the chemical composition.

The H diffusion coefficient of the non-equimolar HEAs that were evaluated by kMC using the DFT calculated H solution energies are listed in Table S1 in Supplementary Materials.
The kMC simulations are used for calculating H diffusion coefficients. Here we only consider the low H-concentration scenario. One H atom was firstly placed in a randomly selected OI site. Due to the complicated local chemical environment of HEA, each OI has 8 different neighboring TIs, so there are 8 different barriers for hopping from OI to TI. The hopping rate to the ith neighboring TI is calculated by(2)ki=v0exp(-DEikBT)
With the trained ML model, we can now predict the complete H solution energies at the critical sites of the HEA atomic structures generated during WOA. The H diffusion coefficient of the structure is calculated through kMC. The H diffusion coefficients at 300 K of the 35 structures are listed in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. At this point, we have established the correlation between the atomic structure of the alloy and its H diffusion coefficient.

WOA is an efficient algorithm for structural optimization and displays an excellent balance between exploration and exploitation, enabling searching across a broad space for the optimal solution. However, the WOA method needs modification to search the structural and compositional space of the HEA structure. To be consistent with the structures for the DFT calculation of the H solution energies in quinary HEA, we use the 2 x 2 x 5 FCC supercell with a total of 80 atoms as the optimization object. To search the structural and compositional space simultaneously, each atom of the supercell is allowed to choose from the five elements, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, and Mn. Hence, the atomic structure of the HEA supercell has 580 permutations. By using integers ranging from 1 to 5 to represent the element type and an 80-component vector to represent the permutation of the atoms, we can then iteratively optimize the atomic structure of the HEA supercell to gradually lower the H diffusion coefficient using WOA. We use a vector, X, to represent the atomic structures of HEA. X has two key characteristics: all the elements are integers, and the elemental index should be in the range of 1-5. In addition, we expect the optimized structure to contain all the five elements of HEA, so the structures with less than five elements are excluded. During the optimization, the components of X can easily exceed the range of 1-5. The X will be initiated with random integers in the range of 1-5 if any components of X are lower than 1 or higher than 5. We used 5 whales for hunting within one WOA iteration and performed 300 iterations. The python codes for WOA are presented in the Supplementary Materials.
