Abstract: The broad compositional space of high entropy alloys (HEA) is conducive to the design of HEAs with targeted performance. Herein, a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted prediction and optimization strategy is proposed to explore the prototype FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low hydrogen diffusion coefficients. The model for predicting hydrogen solution energies from local HEA chemical environments was constructed via ML algorithms. Based on the inferred correlation between atomic structures and diffusion coefficients of HEAs built using ML models and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we employed the whale optimization algorithm to explore HEA atomic structures with low hydrogen diffusion coefficients. HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients were found to have high Co and Mn content. Finally, a quantitative relationship between the diffusion coefficient and chemical composition is proposed to guide the design of HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients and thus strong resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.
Data-driven material design is an emerging field of research that searches for the optimal material with great efficiency by avoiding the traditional trial-error material development process [26-29]. Here we propose a data-driven and machine learning (ML) assisted strategy to design HE resistant non-equimolar FeCoNiCrMn HEAs. Our approach is to calculate the H solution energies using density functional theory (DFT) at critical sites of the HEA lattice, followed by ML algorithms to correlate the local chemical environment with H solution energies. H diffusion coefficients are subsequently calculated from H diffusion barriers by kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations [10,30]. Whale optimization algorithms (WOA) [31] then allow us to explore HEA atomic structures with low H diffusion coefficients. Finally, using a polynomial model, we construct a mapping between the H diffusion coefficient and the chemical composition of the HEA. The model suggests that we can regulate the H diffusion coefficient of the HEA by tuning its chemical composition. In particular, HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients are predicted to have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. The quantitative model linking the H diffusion coefficient with the chemical composition of HEA is expected to guide the design of high-performance HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients and strong resistance to HE.
In summary, we have proposed a data-driven and ML-assisted prediction and optimization strategy to assist the design of FeCoNiCrMn HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients. The neural network was used to bridge the relationship between the SOAP descriptors and the H solution energies. With the help of kMC, the H diffusion coefficients based on the H solution energies can be accurately evaluated, and the relationship between the atomic structure of HEA to its H diffusion coefficient can be built. From the data collected from the WOA processes, we found that HEAs with low H diffusion coefficients typically have high Co and Mn content, while those with high H diffusion coefficients have high Fe and Ni content. We then developed linear and polynomial models between the chemical composition and the H diffusion coefficient to guide the design of HEAs with low H diffusion coefficient and high HE resistance.
